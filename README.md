# number-guessing-games
I'm a big believer that creating a number guessing game allows you to use a lot of the basic features of any given programming language: input, output, type casting, condition controlled loops, use of standard libraries (random), reading from and writing to files etc. Even better, playing them is a good ilustration of the power of binary search

### Do you know a more idiomatic way of doing something in one of the programming languages here? Pull requests are very welcome. Suggestions of what modificaitons I should make are also welcome but unless they are about the Python or Scala implementations I cannot guarantee that they will be acted upon.
